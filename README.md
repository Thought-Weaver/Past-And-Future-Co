# L&A Past and Future Co.

This was a project designed as my final project for the CS 101-1 web design course at Caltech over the course of three days. Rather than design a standard e-commerce site, I opted to go for a retrofuturistic company that sells time. This was made with Node.js.

This contains an implementation of both the front-end and back-end, including:

* Retrieving items and displaying them in the store.
* Adding items to your cart (local storage).
* Functional checkout that updates the quantities of items available in the store.
* Admin page for creating, editing, and deleting store items.
* Form for submitting user complaints and queries.

More information about the back-end API is available in the /doc folder.
